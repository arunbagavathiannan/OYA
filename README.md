# 🎥 OYA – Orphic YouTube Assistant  

Ultimately, **OYA seeks to become the creative operating system for YouTubers** — a single platform where **ideation, production, and publishing** live under one roof.  

Today, creators juggle scattered tools: Notion for planning, Google Drive for storage, TubeBuddy for SEO, Discord for feedback, and countless folders on their desktops. OYA’s vision is to unify that chaos into one streamlined workspace built **by creators, for creators.**

## 🚀 What OYA Does
- **Project Organization** → Automatically create structured folders for raw clips, thumbnails, audio, and exports.  
- **Metadata Management** → Store titles, descriptions, tags, and upload goals in one place.  
- **SEO Optimization** → Analyze video titles, descriptions, and transcripts for readability, keywords, and “power words.”  
- **Dashboard View** → Track creator stats, upcoming projects, and personal progress.
